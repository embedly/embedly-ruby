== Requirements

  * querystring <https://github/dokipen/querystring>

== Getting Started

You can find rdocs at http://rubydoc.info/github/embedly/embedly-ruby/master/frames

  require 'embedly'
  require 'json'

  embedly_api = Embedly::API.new :user_agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; mytestapp/1.0; my@email.com)'

  # single url
  obj = embedly_api.oembed :url => 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPbJ4Z5D-n4&feature=topvideos'
  puts obj[0].marshal_dump
  json_obj = JSON.pretty_generate(obj[0].marshal_dump)
  puts json_obj

  # multiple urls with opts
  objs = embedly_api.oembed(
    :urls => ['http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPbJ4Z5D-n4&feature=topvideos', 'http://twitpic.com/3yr7hk'],
    :maxWidth => 450,
    :wmode => 'transparent',
    :method => 'after'
  )
  json_obj = JSON.pretty_generate(objs.collect{|o| o.marshal_dump})
  puts json_obj

  # call api with key (you'll need a real key)
  embedly_api = Embedly::API.new :key => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
          :user_agent => 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; mytestapp/1.0; my@email.com)'
  url = 'http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/21/andy-coulson-phone-hacking-statement'
  obj = embedly_api.preview :url => url
  puts JSON.pretty_generate(obj[0].marshal_dump)

== Configuration options

You can configure some parameters in the api:

 Embedly.configure do |config|
   # prints debug messages to the logger
   config.debug = true

   # use a custom logger
   config.logger = MyAwesomeLogger.new(STDERR)
 end

== Testing

  gem install jeweler
  rake rspec
  rake features # if it complains of missing deps install them

Some tests will fail due to missing api key.  Set the EMBEDLY_KEY environmental
variable with your key to get them to pass.

  EMBEDLY_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxx rake features

To turn on debugging, set the EMBEDLY_VERBOSE environmental variable.

  EMBEDLY_VERBOSE=1 EMBEDLY_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxx rake features

We have provided some commandline tools to test the Embedly interface.

  * embedly_oembed
  * embedly_objectify
  * embedly_preview

Using --help with the commands should give you a good idea of how to use them.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
